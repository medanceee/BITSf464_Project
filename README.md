# Image Classification and Identification



## 📖 Overview

TThis project implements a predictive model for morphological operations on image datasets using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Convolution Neural Networks(CNN). The dataset consists of structured input-output pairs, with labels corresponding to specific structuring elements (SE1-SE8). The model is trained on 80% of the dataset and subsequently evaluated on the remaining 20%.
